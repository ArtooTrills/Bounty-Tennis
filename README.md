# Bounty-Tennis

We have always been fascinated about sports and stats. Arguments on the outcome would not end until the game actually got over. There would always be one stat that could prove that the underdog still had a chance. FiveThirtyEight (http://fivethirtyeight.com/) is a great example of sports journalism done right. See:

### Task

UCI has a great repository of datasets. We are sure you would have heard of them if not used some of them. Here's one on the 2013 Tennis Tournaments https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Tennis+Major+Tournament+Match+Statistics

Your task is to create 3 hypotheses based on the above dataset and validate or invalidate them. In a short document (max 6 pages) detail out your hypothesis, process, experiments and final conclusion. Include relevant graphs and code.

Remember we are going to evaluate you on the following parameters:
 * How you think and how creative you are
 * How you code - structure, comments, and efficiency
 * And how quickly can you learn

If you are going for the kill and you really want to wow us:

1. Use Julia http://julialang.org/
2. Add additional datasets, build out another hypothesis which make your previous ones look trivial or boring.

### Final Words
Fork this repository. When you are done, send us a link to your repository. We would like you to come in and present your code to the whole team. 

May the force be with you!
